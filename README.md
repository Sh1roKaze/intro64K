Abstract
This bachelor's thesis deals with creation of graphic intro with limited size of the produced executable file. To reach this goal OpenGL, together with procedural generation techniques, exe packer and various compiler settings were used. The result is an executable file with size not going over 64kB, which shows Martian spaceships travelling towards the planet Earth.
